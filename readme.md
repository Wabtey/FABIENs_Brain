# Welcome to the Fabien Game Studio's Brain !

To get started: 
- install [Foam](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/)
- import the [Foam template](https://github.com/foambubble/foam-template)

Clone this git directly into your central workspace where all the foam folder are
(_layout, .foam, .vscode, assets, attachments, docs, *etc*)

Once this *massive* brain is on your foam workspace, directly into vscode open the console (ctrl+p) and type `>Foam: Show Graph`
