## Map Patch Note: 28-05-2022

![v3.7.0](/FABIENs_Brain/attachments/MAP/Fabinie_Castle_v3-7-0.png "Damn...")

### Patch Note

- New palette
- Some props are on a certain level (box on the first corridor)
  - the MC (main character) can walk behind the first box (not like pokemon roof)
- Lights in all corridors
- New props
  - Statue
  - Pedestal with pickable item (like in irl museum)
  - Some pointy disk on the temple Walls
  - New Banners (with a nice bend on the floor)
- Shadows for curtains (and chandeliers ?)
- recolor animation and resize to x40
- all is 400% (x40)

### README (really)

I. Animation

Should I give you the animation on the exact same size of the normal export ?
(or let the animation perfect trimed)

- Negative: mass transparency and big file
- Positive: don't have to place it

II. Facade

can now choose if the temple is connected with the second corridor (facade straight with big door) or closed (topdown view of the wall, with a "smaller" big door)
pref changing to close position when the player enter deeply in the room, offcamera
maintain open if staying close to the door (enter or quit as they want)

III. Shadows

I just add simple shade in the temple, add thoses when the lights are ON
By the way, can you tell me if putting the small lamps (columns one) in the same sprite of the chandelier was a good idea or an unexpected interaction with the character

### New Palette

### Additional Note

With github issue, export, renaming timeline (version) and cleaning the big FTO folder took me 2h.
End at 3h40.
